    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <p class="qwert"><b>PROLOGUE</b></p>
    <p">
      Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our<br>
      scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes<br>
      civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair<br>
      of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous<br>
      overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful<br>
      passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents'<br>
      rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two<br>
      hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
      What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
    <p>
      Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and
      bucklers

    <p class="qwerty"><b>SAMPSON</b></p>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <p class="qwertyu"><b>GREGORY</b></p>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
